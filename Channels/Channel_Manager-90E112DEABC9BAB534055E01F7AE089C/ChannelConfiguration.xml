   description="The channel manager application really has been superseded by Iguana 6&apos;s built in ability to import and export channels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But if you used Iguana 5 and the channel manager to save channels then you need something to load that format back into Iguana.  So that is the reason for having this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now there is a catch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The save milestone API changed in Iguana 6 so that it requires a list of files.   This version of the channel manager works around this change by not saving a milestone.  In some ways this is better since one can then check what has been imported and make sure it doesn&apos;t overwrite any useful modules you have.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is really just intended to allow you to migrate existing channels, so I think it works."
